	abstract = {The time-scale for galaxies within merging dark matter haloes to merge with each other is an important ingredient in galaxy formation models. Accurate estimates of merging time-scales are required for predictions of astrophysical quantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass in central galaxies and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies within dark matter haloes. In this paper, we study the merging time-scales of extended dark matter haloes using N-body simulations. We compare these results to standard estimates based on the Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction. We find that these standard predictions for merging time-scales, which are often used in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter than those found in simulations. The discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7 for {Msat/Mhost} {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.1 and becomes larger for more disparate satellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde3.3 for {Msat/Mhost} {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.01. Based on our simulations, we propose a new, easily implementable fitting formula that accurately predicts the time-scale for an extended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to the halo's centre for a wide range of {Msat/Mhost} and orbits. Including a central bulge in each galaxy changes the merging time-scale by {\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textasciitilde10 per cent. To highlight one concrete application of our results, we show that merging time-scales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar mass by satellite accretion by {\textbackslash}textasciitilde40 per cent, with the extra mass gained in low mass ratio mergers.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...539..718C},
	abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium {(ISM).} The model includes the ionization of H {II} regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H {II} regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient {ISM.} This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of Hα to Hβ luminosities, the Hα equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to λ-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to λ-0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

This in fact might pose another problem for simulations of cold dark matter structure formation, as there are recent findings by Taylor, Silk \& Babul that the Milky Way satellites are found preferentially closer to the Galactic Centre and simulations underestimate the amount of central substructure. Further, this universal substructure profile is anti-biased with respect to the underlying dark matter profile. The halo finder {MHF} will become part of the open source {MLAPM} distribution.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011arXiv1101.0002H},
	abstract = {We perform {3-D} dust radiative transfer {(RT)} calculations on hydrodynamic simulations of isolated and merging disk galaxies in order to quantitatively study the dependence of observed-frame submillimeter (submm) flux density on galaxy properties. We find that submm flux density and star formation rate {(SFR)} are related in dramatically different ways for quiescently star-forming galaxies and starbursts. Because the stars formed in the merger-induced starburst do not dominate the bolometric luminosity and the rapid drop in dust mass and more compact geometry cause a sharp increase in dust temperature during the burst, starbursts are very inefficient at boosting submm flux density (e.g., a \${\textbackslash}ga16\$x boost in {SFR} yields a \${\textbackslash}la 2\$x boost in submm flux density). Moreover, the ratio of submm flux density to {SFR} differs significantly between the two modes; thus one cannot assume that the galaxies with highest submm flux density are necessarily those with the highest bolometric luminosity or {SFR.} These results have important consequences for the submillimeter-selected galaxy {(SMG)} population. Among them are: 1. The {SMG} population is heterogeneous. In addition to the canonical scenario of merger-driven starbursts, there is a galaxy pair contribution in which two disks undergoing a major merger but not yet strongly interacting are blended into one submm source because of the large (\${\textbackslash}ga 15\$", or \${\textbackslash}sim 130\$ kpc at \$z = 2\$) beam of submm bolometers. 2. {SMGs} must be very massive {(\$M\_{{\textbackslash}star}} {\textbackslash}ga 6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}{10} {\textbackslash}msun\$). 3. The infall phase makes the {SMG} duty cycle a factor of a few greater than what is expected for a merger-driven starburst. {(Abridged.)}},

Accounting for the observed distributions of quasar column densities and 
variation of {SED} shapes, as well as their dependence on luminosity, 
makes it possible to integrate the observations in a reliable manner and 
provides a baseline in redshift and luminosity larger than that of any 
individual survey. We infer the {QLF} break luminosity and faint-end slope 
out to z{\textasciitilde}4.5 and confirm at high significance ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10 σ) previous 
claims of a flattening in both the faint- and bright-end slopes with 
redshift. With the best-fit estimates of the column density distribution 
and quasar {SED}, which both depend on luminosity, a single bolometric {QLF} 
self-consistently reproduces the observed {QLFs} in all bands and at all 
redshifts for which we compile measurements. Ignoring this luminosity 
dependence does not yield a self-consistent bolometric {QLF} and there is 
no evidence for any additional dependence on redshift. We calculate the 
expected relic black hole mass function and mass density, cosmic X-ray 
background, and ionization rate as a function of redshift and find that 
they are consistent with existing measurements. The peak in the total 
quasar luminosity density is well constrained at z=2.15+/-0.05. We 
provide a number of fitting functions to the bolometric {QLF} and its 
manifestations in various bands, as well as a script to return the {QLF}

We characterize the survey sensitivity and its dependence on profile velocity width, the effect of large-scale structure, and the impact of radio frequency interference in order to calculate the H I mass function with both the {1/V} max and {2DSWML} methods. We also assess a flux-limited sample to test the robustness of the methods applied to the full sample. These measurements are in excellent agreement with one another; the derived Schechter function parameters are phi* (h 3 70 Mpc-3 dex-1) = 4.8 ± 0.3 × 10-3, log (M {*/M} sun) + 2 log h 70 = 9.96 ± 0.02, and α = -1.33 ± 0.02.

Previous calculations predict that the suppression occurs up to a characteristic mass scale of {\textasciitilde}106Msolar, which suggests that pressure has a central role in determining the properties of the first luminous objects at early times. We show that the expected characteristic mass scale is in fact substantially lower (by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3-10, depending on
redshift), and thus the effect of baryonic pressure on the formation of galaxies up to reionization is only moderate. This reduction in the characteristic mass scale is a result of including the fact that the baryons have smoother initial conditions than the dark matter. This smoothing is due to the aftereffects of the coupling with the radiation before recombination. This yields lower pressure gradients than previous estimations in the period from cosmic recombination to z {\textasciitilde} 200, after which the gas cooled down adiabatically and the pressure dropped. At z {\textasciitilde} 10 the suppression of the baryon fluctuations is still sensitive to the history of pressure in this high-redshift era. We calculate the fraction of the cosmic gas that is in minihaloes and find that it is
substantially higher than would be expected with the previously
estimated characteristic mass. Expanding our investigation to the non-linear regime, we calculate in detail the spherical collapse of high-redshift objects in a Lambda cold dark matter universe. We
include the gravitational contributions of the baryons and radiation and the memory of their kinematic coupling before recombination. We use our results to predict a more accurate halo mass function as a function of redshift.},

(H2) to galaxies, based on their total cold gas masses and a few additional galaxy properties. These prescriptions are specially designed for large cosmological simulations, where, given current computational limitations, individual galaxies can only be represented by simplistic model objects with a few global properties. Our recipes allow us to (1) split total cold gas masses between H I, H2, and helium, (2) assign realistic sizes to both the H I and H2 disks, and (3) evaluate the corresponding velocity profiles and shapes of the characteristic radio emission lines. The results presented in this paper include the local H I and H2 mass functions, the {CO} luminosity function, the cold gas mass-diameter relation, and the Tully-Fisher relation ({TFR)}, which all match recent observational data from the local universe.

	abstract = {We present a model for nebular emission in star forming galaxies, which takes into account the effects of dust reprocessing. The nebular emissions (continuum emission, 54 H and He recombination lines and 60 nebular lines from {UV} to {IR}) have been computed with {CLOUDY} and then included into {GRASIL}, our spectrophotometric code specifically developed for dusty galaxies. The interface between nebular emission and population synthesis is based on a set of pre-computed H {II} region emission models covering a wide range of physical quantities (metallicity, density, geometry and number of H I, He I and O {II} ionizing photons). These quantities are fully adequate to describe the emission properties of the majority of star-forming and starburst galaxies. Concerning the extinction properties of normal star forming galaxies, we are able to interpret the observed lack of correlation between the attenuation measured at Hα and in the {UV} band as a consequence of age selective extinction. We also find that, for these galaxies with modest {SFR}, the ratio {FIR}/{UV} provides the best constraints on the {UV} attenuation. The accurate treatment of lines and continuum in dusty galaxies also allows to deal with different {SFR} estimators in a consistent way, from the {UV} to radio wavelengths, and to discuss the uncertainties arising from the different physical conditions encountered in star forming galaxies. We provide our best estimates of {SFR}/luminosity calibrations, together with their expected range of variation. It results that {SFR} derived through Hα , even when corrected for extinction using the Balmer decrement, is affected by important uncertainties due to age selective extinction. Another remarkable result is that {SFR} from {UV} luminosity corrected by means of the ratio {FIR}/{UV} has a small uncertainty. Finally, our model provides a calibration of {SFR} from radio luminosity; its value differs from estimates from other works, but we are able to reproduce the observed {FIR}/radio ratio. These results are relevant to estimates of the contribution of disk galaxies to the cosmic {SFR} at z {\textless}= 1.},

particular care. A chemical evolution code follows the star formation
rate, the gas fraction, and the metallicity, basic ingredients for the
stellar population synthesis. The latter is performed with a grid of
integrated spectra of simple stellar populations {(SSP)} of different ages
and metallicities, in which the effects of dusty envelopes around
asymptotic giant branch {(AGB)} stars are included. The residual fraction
of gas in the galaxy is divided into two phases: the star-forming
molecular clouds and the diffuse medium. The relative amount is a model
parameter. The molecular gas is subdivided into clouds of given mass and
radius: it is supposed that each {SSP} is born within the cloud and
progressively escapes it. The emitted spectrum of the star-forming
molecular clouds is computed with a radiative transfer code. The diffuse
dust emission (cirrus) is derived by describing the galaxy as an axially
symmetric system, in which the local dust emissivity is consistently
calculated as a function of the local field intensity due to the stellar
component. Effects of very small grains, subject to temperature
fluctuations, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons {(PAHs)} are
included. The model is compared and calibrated with available data of
normal and starburst galaxies in the local universe, in particular new
broadband and spectroscopic Infrared Space Observatory {(ISO)}
observations. It will be a powerful tool to investigate the star
formation, the initial mass function {(IMF),} supernova rate {(SNR)} in
nearby starbursts and normal galaxies, as well as to predict the
evolution of luminosity functions of different types of galaxies at
wavelengths covering four decades.},

	abstract = {We perform high-resolution ray-tracing simulations to investigate probability distribution functions {(PDFs)} of lensing convergence, shear, and magnification on distant sources up to the redshift of zs = 20. We pay particular attention to the shot noise effect in N-body simulations by explicitly showing how it affects the variance of the convergence. We show that the convergence and magnification {PDFs} are closely related to each other via the approximate relation μ = (1 - κ)-2, which can reproduce the behavior of {PDFs} surprisingly well up to the high magnification tail. The mean convergence measured in the source plane is found to be systematically negative, rather than zero as often assumed, and is correlated with the convergence variance. We provide simple analytical formulae for the {PDFs}, which reproduce simulated {PDFs} reasonably well for a wide range of redshifts and smoothing sizes. As explicit applications of our ray-tracing simulations, we examine the strong-lensing probability and the magnification effects on the luminosity functions of distant galaxies and quasars.},

	abstract = {The H I mass function ({HIMF)} for galaxies in the local universe is constructed from the results of the Arecibo H I Strip Survey, a blind extragalactic survey in the 21 cm line. The survey, consisting of two strips covering in total {\textasciitilde}65 deg2 of sky, with a depth of cz = 7400 km s-1, was optimized to detect column densities of neutral gas {NH} I {\textgreater} 1018 cm-2 (5 sigma ). The survey yielded 66 significant extragalactic signals, of which approximately 50\% are cataloged galaxies. No
free-floating H I clouds without stars are found. {VLA} follow-up
observations of all signals have been used to obtain better measurements of the positions and fluxes and to allow an alternate determination of the achieved survey sensitivity. The resulting {HIMF} has a shallow faint-end slope ( alpha {\textasciitilde} 1.2) and is consistent with earlier estimates computed for the population of optically selected gas-rich galaxies. This implies that there is not a large population of gas-rich
low-luminosity or low-surface brightness galaxies that has gone
unnoticed by optical surveys. The influence of large-scale structure on the determination of the {HIMF} from the Arecibo H I Strip Survey was tested by numerical experiments and was not found to affect the
resulting {HIMF} significantly. The cosmological mass density of H I at the present time, determined from the survey, Omega H I(z = 0) = (2.0 +/- 0.5) x 10-4 h-1, is in good agreement with earlier estimates. We determine lower limits for the average column densities of the galaxies detected in the survey and find that none of the galaxies have {\textless} 1019.7 cm-2, although there are no observational
selection criteria against finding lower density systems. Eight percent of the signals detected in the original survey originated in groups of galaxies whose signals chanced to coincide in frequency.},

enables an accurate calculation of space densities. The {HIMF} is fitted
with a Schechter function with parameters α=-1.37 +/- 0.03 +/-

cosmological mass density of {HI} in the local Universe is found to be
{ΩHI=} (3.5 +/- 0.4 +/- 0.4) ×

sample allows us to test whether the shape of the {HIMF} depends on local
galaxy density. We find tentative evidence for environmental effects in
the sense that the {HIMF} becomes steeper toward higher density regions,
ranging from α{\textasciitilde}-1.2 in the lowest density environments to
α{\textasciitilde}-1.5 in the highest density environments probed by this blind {HI}
survey. This effect appears stronger when densities are measured on
larger scales.},
